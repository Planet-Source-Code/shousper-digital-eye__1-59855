### Description

This little baby is just a replication of something i saw on TV once...although the one on TV looked better, but wasn't as random :)
 
### More Info
 
You can adjust several aspects of the segments

Its been heavily optimized, and the code isn't commented much at all :(

Sorry, but i'm sure if you know your stuff you'll be able to make sense of it all :)
